# Airfare-Prediction-Model-

Led end-to-end data analysis and machine learning project to predict pricing dynamics in the airline industry.

Conducted robust data preprocessing, feature engineering, and outlier handling using techniques like one-hot
encoding, target-guided encoding, and manual label encoding.

Applied advanced algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and K-Nearest
Neighbours (KNN) to achieve accurate fare predictions, validated through cross-validation.

Automated machine learning pipeline to streamline model development and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal accuracy and scalability for real-world applications and achieved an accuracy of 82 percent Price prediction
